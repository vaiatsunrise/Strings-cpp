# Strings-cpp
C++ programs demonstrating fundamental string operations such as input handling, concatenation, reversal, and palindrome checking. Ideal for students learning C++ string manipulation and I/O operations.

Programs Included
1️⃣ Input and Display a String
File: q1_string_input.cpp

What it does: Takes a string input from the user (supports spaces) and displays it back.

Concepts Used: getline(), basic I/O.

2️⃣ Concatenate Two Strings
File: q2_concatenate_strings.cpp

What it does: Takes two strings from the user and joins them together.

Concepts Used: String addition (+ operator), getline().

3️⃣ Reverse a String
File: q3_reverse_string.cpp

What it does: Reverses a given string and displays the result.

Concepts Used: String indexing, loops.

4️⃣ Palindrome Checker
File: q4_palindrome.cpp

What it does: Checks if the given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

Concepts Used: String indexing, loops, conditional checks.
